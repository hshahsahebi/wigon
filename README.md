**WIGON - What is Going ON**

This python code is an implementation of a Graph-based clustering approach for multi-tweet summarization using a hybrid method. We have used Word2Vec and GloVe for embedding purposes, Infomap and Louvain for communitiy detection purposes, and TF-IDF for representative tweets selection.
For more information, you can read the thorough documentation of the project which is uploaded as Domentation.pdf in this repository.

Documentation on how to use and initiate the project will be provided in future ;)
